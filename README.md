# memory-flip-cards-with-static
Memory Flip Cards is a simple browser-based matching game. The player flips two cards at a time to find matching pairs. If the cards match, they remain face-up; if not, they flip back down. The goal is to match all pairs with the fewest moves and fastest time possible.
